913,impassibility,"One of the attributes of God taught by Plato that God cannot suffer, and is without body, parts or <em>passions</em>.  Greek culture valued reason and viewed passions as a weakness because one is moved by an outside force (e-motion).   Accordingly, God suffers no passions and nothing can be done to move or change the will of an all-powerful, all-knowing god.  This concept was adopted by many early Christians and was integral to some of their creeds.  In Western medieval theology this attribute is also ascribed to glorified bodies in the resurrection, along with agility, clarity, and subtlety. 
"
915,impute,"A fundamental concept of the Protestant doctrine of forensic justification which maintains that the merits of Christ are imputed (applied to) to believers and are thus made or are reckoned as being righteous in God’s eye.

In Luther’s day, a person could purchase an indulgence for oneself or others whether they were living or dead.  In theory, an indulgence only applies to the satisfaction portion of the sacrament of penance so sinners still need to confess, feel true contrition, and receive the pronouncement of absolution from the priest in order to obtain forgiveness of sin, but in practice during the middle ages many persons viewed the purchase of an indulgence as the purchase of forgiveness of sin.
"
924,infralapsarianism,"This is a term for in an internal Calvinst debate regarding the order of God’s decrees which holds that God decreed after the fall of Adam that some individuals would be saved while others would be damned as opposed to the superlapsarianism belief that God first decreed who he would elect to save before he decreed the fall of Adam.

This term is used to describe virtues, graces, and activities that are poured into the soul by the grace of God in contrast to those that are acquired by effort and practice.  This Roman Catholic teaching of infused virtue is also contrasted to the Protestant doctrine of imputed righteousness (also referred to as forensic justification) where believers are deemed righteous (justified) by Christ’s merits being imputed or credited to the believer without any intrinsic worthiness of the individual.

"
930,intelligibility,"Comes from the Latin word for understanding, “intellectus”, and refers to Plato’s distinction between things which can be perceived through our senses (sensible things) and those which can only be understood through our intellect, such as ideas or images in our mind of some ideal item such as a circle.  The term is also used in contrast to the incomprehensibility of the highest divine principle, that was later identified in Christianity as God.
"
932,interdict,"An order from the Pope that no sacraments including baptism, the Eucharist, Penance, and even Christian burial, could be performed in a particular country.  This extreme sanction was used as a political tactic by popes to control kings in the late Middle Ages.

934,"irresistible grace","Refers to the Calvinist teaching articulated in the Synod of Dordt that a sinner cannot resist the grace of God when God elects to give grace to that sinner, even if he did not initially want it.  God’s grace creates a sinner’s willingness to accept God’s grace.

"

For Luther, the law consists of God’s commands regarding how one should live which no one can fully obey.
